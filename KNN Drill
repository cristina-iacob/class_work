Imagine that you work at a credit card company and you're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. You have everyone's purchases split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways that you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts and submit a link below.



Answer:
We can use KNN to create a classifier to determine whether bills will be paid on time, based on the 4 variables (groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment).

The X feature set would include 4 variables: 

dollars spent on groceries last month,
dollars spent on dining out last month,
dollars spent on utilities last month,
dollars spent on entertainment last month,

The y outcome would be bills paid or not.

The model would use the combination of the 4 variables to classify each individual as pay or not pay.
